For foreign students,

Our laboratory welcomes foreign students for both master degree and Ph.D degree candidates.

For research student applicants,

Currently, our laboratory does not accept research students in general
for taking the master course entrance examination because of lack of our
laboratory space. And, research student experience is not required at
our laboratory for taking the examination. Please take and pass the
master course entrance examination directly, and get your seat at our
laboratory. We look forward to seeing you at our laboratory as a master
course student.

If you are MEXT scholarship or the other scholarships candidate which
requires research student experience before master course entrance,
please [contact us](/members).

For exchange foreign student applicants,

Our laboratory welcomes exchange foreign students based on partnership
or collaborations between your university and Tokyo Tech. For further
details, please ask to your university or Tokyo Tech office.
